# Handwriting-DCGAN

## Description
A project for my deep learning class where we created a deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) to attempt to mimic handwritten numbers, trained on the MNIST dataset. Different hyperparameters were tested to find optimal values that produce the most realistic looking fake images.

## Features
- Two .ipynb files, one for each model, originally written in Google Colab.
- One model is a baseline DCGAN which uses leaky ReLU.
- The other model uses ReLU and the clarity and diversity of the generated images are compared.
- Generated results are shown in the respective notebook for each model. 

## Dataset
- [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)
- 60,000 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits, with 10 classes (0â€“9).

## Results
- The full results are shared in the Project Report PDF which is attached in this repository.
- The report details the different hyperparameters that were tested and shows images of the output from the DCGAN when trained using those parameters.  

## Instructions to run the Notebooks
- Upload .ipynb files to Google Drive, open in Google Colab
- No setup required, just run the cells!
- Or try using Jupyter
